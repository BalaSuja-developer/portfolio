                I am a <strong>Java Fullstack Engineer</strong> specializing in building resilient, 
                user-centric platforms that blend robust backend architecture with 
                dynamic frontend experiences. With deep expertise in Java, Spring Boot, 
                REST/GraphQL API design, and rich frontend solutions using React.js, 
                I bridge the gap between business needs and technological execution. 
                My technical leadership is demonstrated through the delivery of 
                production-grade microservices, workflow automation frameworks, and meticulously tested APIs.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environmentsâ€”translating ambitious business goals 
                into elegant, scalable software architectures. Driven by curiosity and practical 
                problem-solving, I excel at dissecting challenging requirements and orchestrating 
                <strong> robust solutions under pressure</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                By championing automated testing and observability, I ensure every line of code 
                contributes to a system that is stable, traceable, and adaptable to change. My work 
                reflects a blend of deep backend mastery, collaborative communication, and a 
                <strong> relentless pursuit of engineering excellence</strong>.
